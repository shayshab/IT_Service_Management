# ITIL Service Management Framework - Personal Detailed Notes

## Project Overview
This is a comprehensive IT Service Management (ITSM) framework implementation that aligns with ITIL (Information Technology Infrastructure Library) standards. The project demonstrates practical application of ITIL processes through a Python-based system for managing IT assets, configuration items, and service dependencies.

## ITIL Alignment & Core Processes

### 1. Configuration Management Database (CMDB)
**ITIL Process**: Configuration Management
- **Purpose**: Maintains accurate information about Configuration Items (CIs) and their relationships
- **Implementation**: 
  - `ConfigurationItem` class tracks name, type, status, and relationships
  - Supports dependency mapping between CIs
  - Example CIs: Web Server, Database, Application Server, Firewall
- **Key Features**:
  - Relationship tracking (e.g., Database depends on Web Server)
  - Status management (Active, Maintenance, Operational)
  - Type categorization (Server, DB, Network)

### 2. Asset Management
**ITIL Process**: Asset Management
- **Purpose**: Manages the complete lifecycle of IT assets
- **Implementation**:
  - `Asset` class with unique ID, name, owner, and lifecycle status
  - Tracks asset ownership and current state
- **Asset Types Demonstrated**:
  - Hardware: Laptops, Servers, Routers, Switches, Storage Arrays
  - Network: Firewall Appliances
- **Lifecycle States**: In Use, Operational, Active, Maintenance

### 3. Service Mapping
**ITIL Process**: Service Design & Service Transition
- **Purpose**: Maps business services to underlying IT assets and CIs
- **Implementation**:
  - `map_service_to_assets()` function creates service-to-asset relationships
  - Enables impact analysis and change management
- **Service Examples**:
  - Website Hosting (Server + Router + Switch)
  - Database Service (Server + Storage)
  - Internal Application (Server + Laptop)
  - Network Security (Firewall Appliance)

### 4. Monitoring & Reporting
**ITIL Process**: Service Operation & Continual Service Improvement
- **Purpose**: Proactive monitoring and status reporting
- **Implementation**:
  - Automated status checks with simulated monitoring
  - Status levels: OK, Warning, Critical
  - Comprehensive reporting across all assets
